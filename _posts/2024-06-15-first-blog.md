Hello, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!

I was born and raised in Sandakan, a charming small town in Malaysia. Malaysia is a country known for its rich diversity of races, cultures, and religions, and growing up in such a multicultural environment has deeply influenced my perspective on life and people.

For my undergraduate studies, I had the incredible opportunity to study in China at one of its prestigious "985 Project" universities. It was an honor to immerse myself in the rigorous academic environment of one of the countryâ€™s top science and engineering institutions, which laid the foundation for my analytical and problem-solving skills.

Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree at the University of Aizu in Japan. As a university focused entirely on computer science, it provides the perfect environment for me to further enhance my expertise in computer engineering. With each step, I feel closer to achieving my goals and dreams.

On a personal note, my Socionics type is SLI, though I know MBTI is more popular these days (for reference, my MBTI aligns closely with ISTP). Like other SLIs, I strive to improve myself and develop my abilities to protect and support the people I care about. As part of the Delta Quadra, I value harmony and prefer to avoid unnecessary conflicts. However, I am equally passionate about taking on challenges, acquiring knowledge, and pushing my limits.

My ultimate goal is to contribute to making the world a better place. I am committed to spreading a sense of love and support, solving problems for others, and promoting mental well-being. I believe that through learning, compassion, and resilience, we can build a brighter and healthier future for everyone.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my blog!
